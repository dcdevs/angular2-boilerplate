# Angular 2 Example

## Dev Dependencies

* babel-core: Transform ECMAScript6 to ECMAScript 5
* babelify: As of Babel 6.0.0 there are no plugins included by default. For babelify to be useful, you must also include some presets and/or plugins.
* babel-preset-es2015: Babel preset for all es2015 plugins.
* browserify: With Browserify you can write code [in the browser] that uses require in the same way that you would use it in Node.
* watchify: Update any source file and your browserify bundle will be recompiled on the spot.
* vinyl-buffer: An alternative to gulp-streamify that you can pipe to, instead of being required to wrap your streams.
* vinyl-source-stream: Use conventional text streams at the start of your gulp or vinyl pipelines, making for nicer interoperability with the existing npm stream ecosystem.
* http-server: http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.
* gulp: gulp is a toolkit that helps you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.

## Installation

* babel: npm i -g babel
* Dependencies: npm install
